- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Yucun-Xie, an undergraduate student at University of Maryland.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in high energy physics and gravitational physics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with CMS collaboration.
- ðŸ“« Email: yucun.xie@cern.ch and xyc@umd.edu.

I have maintained a set of study notes for the physics subjects I am interested. Check the following:
- [Quantum Field Theory](https://github.com/Yucun-Xie/PhysicsNotes/tree/main/Quantum_Field_Theory)
- [General Relativity](https://github.com/Yucun-Xie/PhysicsNotes/tree/main/General_Relativity)
- [Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime](https://github.com/Yucun-Xie/PhysicsNotes/tree/main/QFT_in_Curved_Spacetime)
